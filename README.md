# SDN-IDS-IPS-SIEM-Integration
Practical CASP+ implementation covering enterprise security (GDPR/HIPAA, legacy risks), network hardening (IPv6, 802.1X issues), threat resilience (IDS/IPS/SIEM challenges), and emerging architectures (SDN, mesh networks). Ideal for CASP+ prep, real-world analysis, and hybrid environment insights.

# CASP+ Practical Project
